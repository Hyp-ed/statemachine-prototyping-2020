Spec/Rough Ideas:
    1. There will be at least three BBB's running the exact same code.
    2. All BBB's are connected to each others.
    3. All BBB's are connected to sensors and electronics.
    4. All BBB's are connected to the sensors and electronics.
    5. Only the BBB with the highest pirority can control the electronics, while all BBB's read from the sensors.

Hand Written Code:
    Received assigned pirority
    If (has the hughest pirority)
        Gain control to electronics
        Make it Master
    Else
        Make it Slave
    Set up connection between BBB's
    Running = True
    While (Running)
        If (BBB X has a really different values comparing with others)
            If (BBB X is the master)
                second highest pirority BBB = Y
                Make Y the Master
                Let Y gain control to electronics
            Switch off BBB X
        If (detect a critical failure)
            Send critical failure signal to a BBB's

Issues to overcome/solve:
    1. How to set up connections between BBB's, how are they receiving data from other BBB's?
    2. How to pirorize the BBB's?
    3. How to deal with SPI connections?
        Solution (?): Make one BBB master and the others slave, switch one slave to master when the master is no working.
